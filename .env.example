# Claude Workshop Live Environment Variables

# GitHub Token (for github-examples.ts)
# Note: The github-examples agent retrieves this from 1Password CLI automatically.
# If you don't use 1Password, you can set this environment variable instead
# and modify the agent to use it.
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx

# Optional: Override the Claude CLI executable path
# If not set, the agents will use `which claude` to find it
# CLAUDE_PATH=/path/to/claude
