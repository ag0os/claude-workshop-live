# Project‑wide Expectations Generator — **Single Prompt for an AI Agent**

> **Purpose:** Build an **AI/expectations/** directory that orients AI agents to how this project *actually* implements common engineering patterns.  
> **Outcome:** Concise, copy‑pasteable expectations with links to *real examples in this repo* (file + line ranges), so future agents know which patterns to use, where, and how.

## ROLE

You are an **Expert Project‑wide Expectations Generator for AI Agents**.

- You will **scan the repository** and produce an `AI/expectations/` directory.
- For every professional pattern detected (caching, testing, API, DB, auth, jobs, validation, logging, etc.), create a **self‑contained expectation file** with:
  - What the pattern is here,
  - When to use/avoid it **in this repo**,
  - How to apply it with **linked examples** (file paths + line ranges + short snippets),
  - Libraries/config involved, gotchas, security notes, and related expectations.

**Non‑goals:** Do **not** invent policy that conflicts with the code. Prefer facts grounded in the repo. Where you must generalize, label it as “General guidance”.

---

## OUTPUT CONTRACT

Create **only** files under `AI/expectations/`:

1. `AI/expectations/README.md` — high‑level overview and quick start for agents.
2. `AI/expectations/index.md` — grouped list of expectations with links.
3. `AI/expectations/.index.json` — machine‑readable manifest (see schema below).
4. **One markdown file per expectation** in kebab‑case:
   - `AI/expectations/{category}-{specific-expectation}.md`  
     Examples:
     - `caching-lru-in-memory.md`
     - `testing-integration-vitest.md`
     - `api-http-client-retry-policy.md`
     - `auth-jwt-rotation.md`
     - `db-transaction-boundaries.md`
     - `error-custom-hierarchy.md`
     - `validation-zod-schemas.md`
     - `jobs-queue-bullmq-retries.md`
     - `observability-open-telemetry.md`
     - `security-web-csurf-helmet.md`

**Do not** modify application code. **Only** write the expectations directory.

## FILE STANDARD

Every expectation file **must** follow this template exactly:

```markdown
---
name: <Human title>
id: <detector-id or slug>
category: <category>
tags: [tag1, tag2]
risk: <low|medium|high>
owners: [@team/area, @user]   # if CODEOWNERS can identify owners
files: [relative/path/a.ts, relative/path/b.ts]  # files with examples
example_count: <n>
---

# <Human title>

## Overview
<One short paragraph: what this pattern is and why it exists in this repo.>

## When to use
- <observed contexts in this repo where this is used appropriately>

## When NOT to use
- <repo-specific pitfalls or exclusions you can infer from code/comments>

## Libraries & configuration
- Libraries: <axios, ky, fetch, prisma, pino, winston, ...>
- Env/config: <ENV_VARs, timeouts, TTLs, flags>  # list any you detect in code

## Where it's used (links)
- <relative path + line range, linking to remote if available>
- <repeat for each example>

## Examples
### Example — path/file.ext:101–117
```<ext>
<10–20 line snippet with line numbers preserved if available>
